# Problem Statement:
GitHub hosts a wide array of software projects organized under different topics. Our goal is to collect data on these topics and the top repositories within each topic. This data will be useful for analysis, research, or any other purpose. To achieve this, we will use Python and several libraries, including requests for downloading web pages, Beautiful Soup (BS4) for parsing HTML content, and Pandas for organizing the extracted data into a structured format.

# Tools Used:

Python
Requests library (for downloading web pages)

Beautiful Soup (BS4) (for parsing and extracting information from HTML)

Pandas (for creating and managing data in tabular format)
Steps:

# Scrape the List of Topics from GitHub:

To scrape the list of topics, we'll follow these steps:
Use Requests to Download the Page:

We will make an HTTP request to the URL https://github.com/topics using the requests library. This will allow us to download the HTML content of the GitHub Topics page.
Use Beautiful Soup to Parse and Extract Information:

Once the page is downloaded, we'll use Beautiful Soup (BS4) to parse the HTML content. BS4 helps us navigate the HTML structure and extract the relevant information, such as the topic title, topic page URL, and topic description.
Convert to a Pandas Dataframe:

After extracting the information for each topic, we'll organize it into a structured format. This data will be converted into a Pandas dataframe, making it easier to work with, analyze, and save to a CSV file.
Scrape Top Repositories for Each Topic:

For each topic, we'll also scrape information about the top 25 repositories in that topic. Here's how we'll do it:
For Each Repository, Grab Relevant Details:

We will navigate to the topic's page and extract information for each of the top 25 repositories. The details we'll gather for each repository include:
Repository Name
Username of the Repository Owner
Number of Stars
Repository URL
Create a CSV File for Each Topic:

For each topic, we'll organize the data of the top repositories in the following format: "Repo Name, Username, Stars, Repo URL." This information will be written to a CSV file for that specific topic.
By following these steps, we will collect valuable data about GitHub topics and their top repositories, which can be used for various analytical and research purposes.
